SortUtils
=========

This is a library of sorting algorithms I have learned in my algorithms class. The goal is to implement each of the algorithms as revision for my final exam, and then to be able to utilise them in the future if an occasion arises.

The following algorithms are planned to be implemented:

> **Note:** The names of the algorithms are according the class notes I have 
been taught with, and therefore may be different than usual.

Brute Force:
------------
  - Selection sort
  - Bubble sort
  - Bubble sort (Early termination)

Decrease and Conquer:
---------------------
  - Insertion sort
  - Shell sort
  
Divide and Conquer:
-------------------
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort
  
Time and Space Tradeoffs:
-------------------------
  - Distribution sort
